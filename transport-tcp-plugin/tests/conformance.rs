//! plugins test themselves against busbar). busbar's suite, at the commit this repo pins
//! (`.busbar-ref`), drives the `tcp` framer two ways through the one loader: LINKED (the logic
//! crate's `door::door`) and DROPPED IN (this crate's built cdylib), over the transport kind's
//! script with the inputs in `conformance.json`; every step's crossings exactly at the script's
//! pin, the two folds equal, and the suite's RED arms kept. `plugin-ci.yml` runs it under
//! `--release`.
